        Source picture in deck / anki would be awesome feature. Later, can grab still image from inside YT.
        Add epoch + next 500 if epoch is small, makes feed more efficient and interesting.
        Put some full YT videos in the feed? Or in exports or somewhere? Put Chinese subs on by default settings.


        There are ~1300 Phrases with None Content (--> no content_lang):
                - If they have deck_obj defined, try to match with that
                - Otherwise, create a default ZH Content for them

        Standardize content_lang to LOWER_CASE b/c that is how YT uses the codes
        Create conditionally required fields with Django - requires javascript.
'Production' card in mp3/mp4 should put English first with some verbal prompt

        Exports - put a 'RECOMMENDED' item in there each day, flag that it is **recommended**
                        - automatically create Deck from recently added (but not reviewed) content!
                        - Any Notes we add, automatically PUSH a review in 1-2 days

        Multi-way translation:
                Use single language definition, then translate
                common_lib should translate to multiple outgoing languages

        Move ecdict / cedict somewhere outside of git - files too big!
                - Insert the data in to database will make start-up faster, and reduce memory-footprint
                - Lots of dictionary loading at startup making it SLOW

##### What works well, What it doesn't do well yet #####

Vision: Multilingual Life

	Chinese:
		HANZI reading is great, Congratulations! SOLVED 
	
	Lacking:
		1) Your listening skills are still not good enough to follow conversation, even if you know all the vocab.
			- Not enough sound, not focused enough on the SPOKEN form.
			- WORD (spoken freq) tracking could help with this.
			- WORDS aren't tracked, so we can't target the 5,000-10,000 words of HSK
			- ** HIRE professional speaker to record 5000 common phrases **
		2) Grammar - you know enough words, but you can't put them in to complex sentences. 
			- Probably just 100 example sentences would be enough to base your conversations on.
			- these come from analysing transcripts of (usually second language Chinese speakers) and copying the forms they use (because usually they use more accessible forms)
				- really feels like ANALYSING and TRYING TO USE these forms is key. You really need to see these spoken sentences written down to absorbe their strucutre. Just listening/reading passively won't help with this.
				- Copy aileen Gu's conversation and that 18-month learner guy in to a Production Deck.
				- Contact the 18-month guy to get his notes/advise on grammar forms.
	
	1)
		English Feed is *necessarily* a WORD-based feed, so build that, and see where things are.
		The word feed should emphasise LISTENING to SPOKEN / CONVERSATIONAL language. Like a tiktok feed.
		Get native English Speaker / Chinese Speaker to record ~1000 Phrases (with text transcripts of course), so we have variety of sources
	
	2) 
		Grammar analyser - our production efforts should analyse most useful / popular grammar patterns and give these equal weighting (similar to Feed) 
		Currently, I learn grammar too slowly because most sentences are not grammatically "interesting"
		In the grammar/production feed, every item should be helping me develop more sophisticated sentences
		Could some clozures help here?
		Focus on:
			1) Translating complex English sentences in to Chinese e.g. London has many glass and steel towers. They are covered in glass, so act like a "green house" in the sun, and have no way to let air blow through the building to clear out hot air. 
			2) Maybe get italki teacher to correct these for you / penpal relationship
		Focus on 'sentence building components like conjunctions' e.g. 通过，因为，所以，到底，当，在X里，唯一 etc.
			- our APP should put EXTRA weight on these things s.t. we feature their use more often

##### Small items that need fixing #####
########################################


SITE:
	Key on User not on UserRegistration?
	Bugs / Issues:
		- Lots of blank lines in youtube loading
		- SRS ordering is screwed up

	Fix video to play correctly in Firefox
	Opening doc in a second language will do line-by-line translations :( SLOW
	KILLER FEATURE: Anki export should take the img from Content, and for YT, create a short gif (or still) from the section
	Fix 5x too long Notes translations (split in 2 parts?)
		- Currently Feed has missing translations
	FIXME - so little video or sound in Feed now (quota min 1/3 ?)
		- Add sound_file for feed phrases where it makes sense
	Add TARGET_FREQ_RANK to settings page. Put all 'goal' type options there.
	Fix 'spanning new line' noise, EN/ES don't need to go through group_lines function
	What happens to Content.lang if Content is deleted? Phrases deleted too?
	In text Notes, there should be a play option for every line
	
	'Phrases in your decks' is now 'Phrases in your Notes'

	Understand why Phrase.get_phrase_str is needed (if not, delete it) 

	Put 'play' option next to all lines in Notes
	Episode word report for EN, hide <hanzi_report> links for non-ZH
	En bugs re: "doll's", "out."  ??
	EN->ZH dictionary

	As we identify top hanzi, top words, we should identify the top (say, 100) spoken sentence patterns and really drill these in. But we need to find a way to identify them. Contact the guy for some help! Maybe he can give you his grammar notes.
