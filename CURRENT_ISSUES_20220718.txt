	Chinese:
		HANZI reading is great, Congratulations! SOLVED 
	
	Lacking:
		1) Your listening skills are still not good enough to follow conversation, even if you know all the vocab.
			- Not enough sound, not focused enough on the SPOKEN form.
			- WORD (spoken freq) tracking could help with this.
			- WORDS aren't tracked, so we can't target the 5,000-10,000 words of HSK
			- ** HIRE professional speaker to record 5000 common phrases **
		2) Grammar - you know enough words, but you can't put them in to complex sentences. 
			- Probably just 100 example sentences would be enough to base your conversations on.
			- these come from analysing transcripts of (usually second language Chinese speakers) and copying the forms they use (because usually they use more accessible forms)
				- really feels like ANALYSING and TRYING TO USE these forms is key. You really need to see these spoken sentences written down to absorbe their strucutre. Just listening/reading passively won't help with this.
				- Copy aileen Gu's conversation and that 18-month learner guy in to a Production Deck.
				- Contact the 18-month guy to get his notes/advise on grammar forms.
	
	1)
		English Feed is *necessarily* a WORD-based feed, so build that, and see where things are.
		The word feed should emphasise LISTENING to SPOKEN / CONVERSATIONAL language. Like a tiktok feed.
		Get native English Speaker / Chinese Speaker to record ~1000 Phrases (with text transcripts of course), so we have variety of sources
	
	2) 
		Grammar analyser - our production efforts should analyse most useful / popular grammar patterns and give these equal weighting (similar to Feed) 
		Currently, I learn grammar too slowly because most sentences are not grammatically "interesting"
		In the grammar/production feed, every item should be helping me develop more sophisticated sentences
		Could some clozures help here?
		Focus on:
			1) Translating complex English sentences in to Chinese e.g. London has many glass and steel towers. They are covered in glass, so act like a "green house" in the sun, and have no way to let air blow through the building to clear out hot air. 
			2) Maybe get italki teacher to correct these for you / penpal relationship
		Focus on 'sentence building components like conjunctions' e.g. 通过，因为，所以，到底，当，在X里，唯一 etc.
			- our APP should put EXTRA weight on these things s.t. we feature their use more often
