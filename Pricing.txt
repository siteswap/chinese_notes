SYNTAX_ANALYSIS:  

$0.1c / request (i.e. 1 USD per 1000 requests)
Large documents charge for 1 request per 1000 unicode characters

So, segmenting 1000 TV-shows should cost 8 USD:
	1000 episodes  x  ~8requests/episode  x  $0.1c

TRANSLATION:

translate_client.translate

$20 / million characters
2.0c / 1000 characters
So, updating a 4000 char document would cost ~8c

NB - more costly than segmentation for large docs, but as there's no fixed cost per request, cheaper when updating a phrase

TEXT-TO-SPEECH:
WaveNet
$16 / million characters
0.128c / 80 characters (30 hanzi + 50 chars of markup)

Src: https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/pricing


So, every 'Update Phrase' costs ~0.25c (0.1 segmentation min charge, 0.05 translation, 0.1 wavenet)
Each, 'Add to Deck' costs 0.1c since we only require wavenet.
Update/Create a Note costs:
	0.3c for 100 char document (0.1 segmentation min charge, 0.2c for translating 100 chars)
	8.4c for 4000 char document (0.4c segmentation, 8.0c translation)

NB - if you amend a 3500 char document twice / day, you've already cost $5.20 per month!!!
