Meh - just has some static decks that you review ANKI-style.

No ability to load in your own documents. 
No ability to build your own decks.
The google voice is that cheap one.
No frequency info etc. etc.
I'd rather use TrainChinese.

It *is* pretty though.

##### DuoLingo #####
###################

DuoLingo does not use SRS:

https://blog.duolingo.com/review-exercises-help-measure-learner-recall/

###################
####### LingQ ######
###################

PROS:
---------
SRS via 'Review Settings' ->: 
	Speech-only flashcards: Dictation -> 'Auto Text-to-Speech' ON.
	Hanzi-only flashcards: Flashcard ->  'Auto Text-to-Speech' OFF & Front:Term & Back:Translation
	Production flashcards: Reverse Flashcard -> Front:Translation & Back:Phrase.
Lingq let's you export your lingq words to an ANKI file 
	- BROKEN: cards missing front text, no sound.
Can also export as a csv, where you get "term | phrase | meaning".
Has a 'make known' similar to fluentU's 'Already know' which sets it to 'seen 5 or 8 times' and not shown again.
Very sophisticated sort and filter functionality for managing lingqs
Import your existing vocab as a csv file:
	- BROKEN: Ran the upload, nothing seemed to update
Import subtitles from netflix / youtube:
	- BROKEN

CONS:
---------
No frequency info or word-ranks used, so can't pick out the most useful words
Because of the lack of frequency info, we can't find relevant content to learn from or revise
	- not much info on how many new words, new hanzi etc are there
	- Import any text, then go to vocab and filter by lesson title, you'll get list of EXISTING lingqs, but not any of the new (blue) words.
ANKI export only does "term | phrase | meaning" and even that doesn't work
Seems SRS is all-items or nothing, but can't revise individual decks, we lose the original article reference
	https://www.lingq.com/en/community/forum/support-feedback-forum/srs-question
	"My big problem is that there is apparently no way to make different decks. It seems like it is always drawing words from your total list on LingQs."

###################
###### Fluentu ######
###################

PROS:
Best word_info cards I've seen. Almost perfect.

There are 153 sets of flashcards available, based on content, like: 'Integrated Chinese Chapter 19', 'Dating', 'HSK', 'intermediate grammar'.

I can see the word list and add items to 'Already Known' (meaning they wont be shown again), or I can add them to a new or existing flashcard set.

The card info is really nice: 
	- Several example phrases:
		- Spoken
		- With translations
		- Popover for each word
		- Link to word_info for each word
	- (noun) dad; daddy
	- Picture

Flashcards include ones for grammar points like "帮 + someone + action".
Word-Search: You can search for words & phrases to find cards and add these to a custom deck - nice.

CONS:
No frequency info, so you can't prioritize or fill-in gaps. Same issue as most sites - patchwork.
You can't input your own content, so you're stuck with their curated examples - not much regular dialogue. Also - patchwork. Also - can't customize to your own interests like: Court-dramas, or Datascience lectures etc.
No way to see "what do I know, what dont I know".
No concordance with other content - so not so helpful for tracking lesson notes.
No 'custom reports' like homophones or 'similar hanzi'.
I can't edit the cards myself (no custom notes, custom phrases, custom pictures, concordance)
Can't export your cards, so you're stuck in their walled-garden.
The flashcards only quiz you with auto-generated, multichoice cloze cards - this isn't testing the long-term recall, and the multichoice cards are too easy to guess. Also, you're not testing listening skills.

Unclear: word info sometimes refers to all relevant concordance, sometimes just to canned phrases. That's probably ok.

###################
###### Pimsleur #####
###################

PROS
The best content for just LISTENING to, because it's given explanations in english in the audio. 
It's comprehensible input without a screen.
Its all focused on conversation/dialogues (not stories). Levels 4 and 5 are at a good level for you.

CONS
No ongoing SRS, so you can forget what you learned earlier.
Not clearly identifying target vocab
Very linear progression, hard to pick out relevant bits.
Very focused on travel, business trips, hotels etc.

###################
#### DuChinese #####
###################

PROS
All content is professionally spoken (same as maayot), and you can change the speed of the speech.
Clicking on a word makes the recording jump to that point - nice!

CONS
It's very HSK focus, not real dialogues, doesn't translate well to movies. Can't be customized to particular interests.
Can't upload my own content
No frequency measures
SRS: flashcard is reading only (no sounds, or phrases)
SRS: example sentence isn't spoken


###################
###### Maayot ######
###################

PROS
High quality, daily updated content is really nice.

CONS
Very reading-orientated text. Not useful for learning to listen. Very HSK, not natural speech.
Includes A LOT of high-frequency words (and probably misses low frequency ones).
No sense of SRS, revisiting relevant words, measured progression.
 -> it would be good, if you could load it in to speakize!

###################
#### chinesepod #####
###################

CONS
no transcript / subtitles so you if they say something you don't understand, there's no way to make it 'comprehensible input'.
Like most sources, the topic/vocab/phrases don't fit into any clear framework for progression.
