1) Explore the site unprompted

Start - 19:10

Goes to 'Start Here' though tempted to click along the menus

Woah, that's a lot of incomprehensible chinese chars

I won't 'add to deck' because I don't know what a deck is

I'd like to 'Study Now' because I know about that.

He adds some english to a new notes

"im looking to see how to start"

BUG - Server Error 500 - by hitting WordList with now chinese text.

Tentatively adds 1 word in most frequent words report

Puzzled by "whats hard and whats easy" is this feedback?

Goes back to most frequent words
 -  do I have to select all of these individually? not fun.

So, what do I have
Useful list of words, but no english translation. Why? 

Gets lost when updating phrase (no buttons)

Clicks 'Speakize' but thinks he's stuck.

I don't understand the utility of all thse 1, 2, 3 steps -> maybe some graphics

keeps adding only english to new items


2) Quiz about basic Value Proposition

Duolingo is spoonfed in to you
It's super obvious
No big red 'go here'

The steps 1,2,3 text is very clear, BUT, my eye is draw directly to buttons. I want to press buttons first, only after that failed did I back to read the text.

New idea:

1) Go straight to flashcards 
2) Very first text should introduce "as you go"

"how did you find that?"  Easy | Hard

3) Graphics (preferred by Jared as videos too slow for him) as you go, like the duolingo experience.
Other people like a 60s video on the landing page

Backend would still look same, but the initial bit needs more explanation about what it is.

Start with flashcards (inc instructions)
Then, maybe some easier ways to import content. Pre-include some content if possible.

Many of the pages are ugly looking, compared to pretty DuoLingo.

Jared likes the gamification of DuoLingo. He uses it for brain training, not worried about actual skills.
