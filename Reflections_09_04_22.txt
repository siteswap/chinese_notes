Top wants:
1) Be able to make different types of card from the same lesson - especially for these italki things.
2) Make 3 card types export nicely to ANKI

NEED:
	Learn PHRASES, not indvidiaul words.
		- must learn the relevant collocations and phrasal verbs 
		- nb a list of know words cannot be processed, you must learn the patterns
	Need repeated SOUND exposure to train the ear:
		- graded to learner's speed
		- a standard pronunciation
	Do need to do a bit of sentence production to really understand the grammar:
		- i.e. the bidirectional method

	For HANZI, current method works pretty well.

################################

FF method mostly nails it apart from:	
	- focus on phrases, not words
		- help from phrase optimizer?
	- cards need SOUND
		- SOLVED
	- TV series need to be graded for the watcher (with subs to feedback from)
		- grade youtube subtitles content?

Although the flashcard approach is very EFFICIENT, you tend to want to move on to TV asap because:
	- flashcards are boring
	- TV gives really good CONTEXT for words/phrases

Keep using flashcards to:
	- Feedback on mistakes / interesting examples from your TV / talks.
	- Target specific areas of vocab e.g. software, econ, oratory
	- Train listening skills on content that is otherwise too fast

For these reasons, you probably wouldn't use flashcards alone to get to 20,000 word vocab - too dull and would not get the meaning.

As a LESSON -> FLASHCARD tool

Remember the Notes + Decks pattern was because we had lots of lesson notes. Also, we often want to annotate like "what is the difference between 应用 and 程序). I like to dump feedback from penpals in there, and maybe only create flashcards later.

You can imagine a CompSci or Medical lecture where you have the main lesson with lots of detail, but also some flashcards summarizing the main points. We want to keep the long-form lesson.

Some way to combine the efficiency of SRS method with fun of other stuff:
	- Grade youtube based on subs
	- Create stream of changing videos / reading clips to hit your revision goals

i.e. you need to revise 改善, so use the web-interface to pull a 10 second clip from youtube using 改善。
i.e. you need to revise word 咒骂 and 亲戚, so find short newspaper extracts using these words.

################################

OPTIMIZED PHRASES - really like the principle, but it prioritizes weird, un-natural phrases. phrases from TV/talks give me something that I really connect to.
As a first 1000 words / first 1000 phrases tool, this would be awesome - could it pull from youtube subtitles search?
