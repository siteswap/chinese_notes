Goes straight to 'Start Here' link (great start)

highlighting and buttons come before introduction - confusing and disjointed:
	Don't understand the buttons
	highlighted 'white' confusing - just say not highlighted
	Translations on/off is nice
This should be the first thing on the page: "just 60 words cover 50% of spoken Chinese" (it got an "oh, wow")

Clicked on 'Word List':
	Confused by 'you know 3% already'
	Confused by 'from this article' - "what article"?

Lots of confusion seeing 'Start Here' everywhere -> its an article name, deck name, and call to action.

"I want to add words to deck without leaving the article" - do this as a popover

Takes a long time browsing around the site, but never:
	Gets to 'Study Now' 
	Menu: Decks
	Menu: Words

Wants to play sample sentence without adding it to deck
Clicking Speakize doesn't do anything
Don't like sound of "Example" in the middle of the speech. Though, not so bad if example is long.

He never clicks Again|Hard|Good|Easy.

TODO:
	Make "60 words cover 50%" first thing on page. Move everything else to bottom.
	Add to deck from article with button in popover.
	Create a 'Study Now' link from article page? (with a 1 off how-to on SRS buttons?)
	Less jarring texttospeech voice?
