Phase 1 - x30 iterations of functional prototypes and talking to customers & UX testing sessions
Phase 2 - Launch, aim for product-market fit based on returning usage metrics (keep prototype iterations in background)

	- Monetization is a much easier problem than product-market fit
	- Focus on getting a functional prototype in front of users ASAP (don't worry about scaling)
		- use throwaway code
	- Fast prototyping and high-iterations to find the "hidden needs"
		- think x30 iterations

Important:
	1. Ensure you are talking to your target customers. It's not helpful to just talk to anyone.
	2. Anecdotal is ok, don't overthink it. More iterations are better than more planned iterations.

Most helpful tools:
	1. Customer interviews (5-10 needed) [ @22:00 ]
		- talk to customer on phone for ~1 hour about their *problems*, get a qualitative view
	2. UX testing sessions (3-5 needed)
		- someone uses your app in front of you
		- ask they give open & honest feedback
		- ask them to perform a taks (you say NOTHING)
		- its normal for them to struggle, and this is agonising to watch
		(only 3 sessions needed to uncover most critical issues)
	3. Metrics from your site


When Launch one of these prototypes:
	MVP: Mimimum **Remarkable** Product
	Launch as soon as the product does 1 thing better than anyone else.

Prioritizing:
	Don't optimize for cost x benefit
	Optimize for Learning value - learning tasks change your priorities

Product-market fit definition
	1. Returning usage (Day 1, 3, 7, 30 retention)
	2. NPS (Should be > 50) "How likely to recomend to recommend this?"
	3. Paying customer renewal rates

Scaling the team:
	Don't scale past 20 people before finding product-market fit
	Good to know everything that is going on, for making good decisions
	Once you've found product-market fit, scale aggressively to capture it before others do

When to raise a round:
	Early 'traction' phase
