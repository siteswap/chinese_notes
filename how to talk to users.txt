	(this can inform your marketing)
4) what, if anything, have you done to try to solve this problem?
	(what tools did they use)
	(what *did* they find really effective?)
5) what don't you love about the solutions that you've tried?

Finding first customers for questions (10-15 minutes):

	- Ask friends and coworkers for introductions to relevant people
	- Just show up to industry relevant events

Tips:
	- Take detailed notes (ask if you can record if you can't take notes fast)
	- Keep it casual
	- Careful with their time (10-15 minutes)

Identify who will be your best first customer/s:
