MUST HAVES:
	Input validation
	https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/forms/validation/

	Bug - handle translation failures better (1000 line limit, 100 article limit).
	Bug - content item name not sanitized. Slugify.  (See how google cloud looks re site tree and query strings)
	Bug - deck name not sanitized. Slugify. (It's good to have the episode name as part of the url, this is good design)
	Bug - phrase field needs a limit
	Bug - Max limits and quotas on everything expensive to run (e.g. anki exports! - quotas table)

	Bug - RAND issue - piece apart with a loop, might make segmentation better too.
	Bug - Tables should probably link through User, not RegistrationProfile

	Do the basic usability feedback stuff from Andrew & commit 'Start Here' article

I think these 2 things offer a USP:
	AI:
		Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
			-> 这种以为造成意外 -》 so much value in this phrase!
		Recognise cross training occured (need to log reviews)

NICE
	Popover for words in word_list
	Button: sort by most occurances in article (have full reports in a hidden /stats)
	Use translations from CE.tsv
	Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
	Word search field
	Turn off loop where no example phrase
	'Already Know' button for use when importing existing cards - access via big 'Words' table
	Target words - include pts for KnownWords as base, then add.

FEATURES:
	Make existing reports all in views on some core word explorer, with some buttons to set 


FUTURE ROADMAP:
	AI:
		Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
		Recognise cross training occured
		Target ease:comprehension value
	Rotating phrases (same word, different contexts)
	SRS based content recommendation - cover SRS goals, but in more interesting way
	Multimedia - pictures, short videos
	Better stats tracking progress, word reviews etc.
