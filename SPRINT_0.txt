Simplification - make the produce communicate it's use and purpose!
	What's the meaning of Cover in Most Frequent Word report?
	Blurb for 
	Get top 150 words phrases from Fiverr writer (Call it 'Intro/Welcome' and explain how to use the site)
	Get Jared to review the copy

#############################################

MUST HAVES:
	1) Fix Admin ProfileRegistration corrupt

	2) SRS doesn't make sense without this:
	Move chosen phrase more prominently - needs database to persist segmented + translated version
		-> then can export this to anki

	3) "Start Here" article - starts with 'how to', then includes top 150 word examples


	Input validation
	https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/forms/validation/

	Bug - handle translation failures better (1000 line limit, 100 article limit).
	Bug - content item name not sanitized. Slugify.  (See how google cloud looks re site tree and query strings)
	Bug - deck name not sanitized. Slugify. (It's good to have the episode name as part of the url, this is good design)
	Bug - phrase field needs a limit
	Bug - Max limits and quotas on everything expensive to run

	Bug - RAND issue - piece apart with a loop, might make segmentation better too.


I think these 2 things offer a USP:
	AI:
		Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
			-> 这种以为造成意外 -》 so much value in this phrase!
		Recognise cross training occured (need to log reviews)

NICE
	Popover for words in word_list
	Button: sort by most occurances in article
	Use translations from CE.tsv
	Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
	Fix 999999 rank -> call 'unranked'
	Word search field
	Turn off loop where no example phrase
	'Already Know' button for use when importing existing cards
	Target words - include pts for KnownWords as base, then add.

FEATURES:
	Make existing reports all in views on some core word explorer, with some buttons to set 


FUTURE ROADMAP:
	AI:
		Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
		Recognise cross training occured
		Target ease:comprehension value
	Rotating phrases (same word, different contexts)
	SRS based content recommendation - cover SRS goals, but in more interesting way
	Multimedia - pictures, short videos
	Better stats tracking progress, word reviews etc.

It's hard to know where to start with learning Chinese. There are so many courses, apps, text books and word lists available.

But, if you want to quickly improve your comprehension of spoken Chinese, it's a good idea to start with the most frequently used words first.

(If you want to know the top written words, here is a list: <google_ngram>)

It's also a good idea to base your learning on content that is relevant to your goals. So, if your goal is to follow casual conversation, then TV series dialogue could be a good learning resource.

Add the content you like - subtitles<href=opensubtitles.org> for your TV shows, lesson notes etc. The tool will identify words most relevant to your learning, as well as the most helpful phrases to learn these words in-context. It will then create spoken word flashcards so you can train your ear, and use spaced repetition (Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) so that you don't forget.

So: 
	1) Add content relevant to you
	2) Create spoken word flashcard decks from the high-value words and phrases
	3) Keep up with the flashcard reviews
	4) Repeat

To help you get started, here are some phrases using the most frequently spoken 150 Chinese words:
