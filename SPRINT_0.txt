MUST HAVES:
	Bug - sound doesn't update when Update button is pressed
	Bug - server error 500 when adding lots of words from word_report
	Bug - handle translation failures better (1000 line limit, 100 article limit).
	Bug - - - -	max limits and quotas on everything expensive to run
	Bug - content item name not sanitized. Slugify.  (See how google cloud looks re site tree and query strings)
	Bug - deck name not sanitized. Slugify. (It's good to have the episode name as part of the url, this is good design)
	Bug - RAND issue - piece apart with a loop, might make segmentation better too.


I think these 2 things offer a USP:
	AI:
		Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
		Recognise cross training occured (need to log reviews)

NICE
	Use translations from CE.tsv
	Move chosen phrase more prominently - needs database to persist segmented + translated version
		-> then can export this to anki
	Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
	Word search field
	Turn off loop where no example phrase
	'Already Know' button for use when importing existing cards
	

FEATURES:
	Make existing reports all in views on some core word explorer, with some buttons to set 


FUTURE ROADMAP:
	AI:
		Optimize choice of phrases ** do this, it's easy and it's a USP
		Recognise cross training occured
		Target ease:comprehension value
	Rotating phrases (same word, different contexts)
	SRS based content recommendation - cover SRS goals, but in more interesting way
	Multimedia - pictures, short videos
	Better stats tracking progress, word reviews etc.
