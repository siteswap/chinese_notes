HeatMap of Hanzi (and words) - quickly shows us what we have/have-not recently reviewed.
One click 'add' card (just like ANKI plugin on phone).




A) For each priority-review, fetch something from youtube library or zhihu.

Rotating, novelty news feed (Word report so static)
	- Make 'Speakize' promote mp3/mp4 exports, short videos, pictures (see 知乎 is example of this). 
	- zhihu headlines are brilliant for grabbing your attention, very click-baity

Media feed:
	- Use user site browsing data to suggest stuff they haven't looked at for a while
	- Consider a page view or an mp3/mp4 export a 'passive exposure'
	-> Prompt user with hanzi they've not had 'passive exposure' to
		- Create a 50 x 50 grid of hanzi, with heatmap of exposure!!!

Limit 'related hanzi' to ones in your database (or highlight grey)

HANZI FEATURES:
Hanzi should still be presented:
	- in context of high-freq word
	- inside a meaningful PHRASE (didn't do this on my anki deck)
		- One writing based from sohu
		- One speaking based from youglish / zerotohero
	- exploded decomposition should accompany new hanzi, so we learn to see the decomp:
		- emphasise differences from similar hanzi **
	- whole phrase spoken clearly and slowly (youglish is typically spoken too quickly to be clear)
	- picture or short video to give a sense of the idea

** We currently show hanzi where the whole character is part of the hanzi. 
   We should also show hanzi that share a component, like 氛 is related to 汽, 拿 is related to 盒.
	- this can help use learn new characters by building on a WEB of connections.


Hanzi progress:
	Recognise hanzi use in full sentence
	Recognise hanzi in a word (same word used in that sentence)
	Recognise hanzi on it's own
	Write the hanzi when given a closure of a sentence
	
Export option:
	Hanzi phone/desktop wallpaper

Explore by radical?
	 - How to learn writing by focusing on the hanzi with known radicals?
	 - Rank most used component radicals, challenge to draw all the hanzi with these standard rads
	 - Draw a network graph
	 - Give me some phrases to write that cover the major hanzi


query_string vs POST body best practise:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25385559/rest-api-best-practices-args-in-query-string-vs-in-request-body
NB - POST body is more for data than query params


Words -> Reports (Hanzi, Words, Phrases)
word_list.html -> tabular_report.html OR phrase_table.html** OR phrase_report.html

BUGS:
Fix the 1-second imprecision.
Export As Episode should be disabled for incompatible deck types
FIX multiple downloads of same file - inefficient
Pop-up to include: per hanzi, the top word in user's vocab
No sound on ipad - not useful for kids without this.

#### Big stuff:
How to drive new words?:
	- Pre-load database from yt transcripts? Try this (good option, lets us optimize, script it)
	- For words with low representation - pro-actively search.
'Show me new' button - will scrape some news sites, pull out bits with 1 or 2 novels words/hanzi
Content library difficulty rating
Live-updating flashcards?
##################################################################################################
#### Small stuff:
Small thumbnails - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2612436/create-thumbnail-images-for-jpegs-with-python
Use Content_id instead of name -> solves: name clashes, title editing etc.
	- Creating a new note with same name, deletes the old one, tho phrases are retained.
RegistrationUser -> User
Some way to use AI to reduce large transcripts to "top 20" phrases that describe the key ideas?
	- Automatic Text Summarization with Machine Learning
	- https://huggingface.co/tasks/summarization
Fix anki deck export for 3 card types
Be able to edit / create our own translations (could create some interesting card options)
	- 我们才能够试验出来这种药到底是有效还是没有效
Be able to annotate / reduce movie transcript - mixed type deck
Deal with big yt imports, slow rendering
Delete buttons for phrase and deck

# ipad mp4 no audio - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8343552
	- issue is encoding h.264 (newer) vs mpeg-4 (older) ?

Report features: Series_level_stats, include_known_words, sort_by_occurences, sort_by_video_time

NOTES ON VIDEO:

	Preceed / splice 5 new words/phrases based on:
		- High-use in the episode: 停电
		- High-use in the series: 恐龙, 乔治，花园
		- High-use in general language: 爸爸，妈妈，非常好

	I try listening to some video on 百度, 哔哩哔哩, zhihu, and although I know all the hanzi:
		- I can't quite understand the kouyin (speed? clarity?)
		- I feel vague about the meaning 

	Keep working on this video thing, it's got legs. Especially as a video board.
		- Compare word usage across all videos
		- Put the English bits inside the complete video (7.5Mb / 5 minute show).
		- Fix Paige -> Peppa!
		- Create an interface that you could leave them alone with, and they would explore 50 episodes of Peppa pig.

	How to make this PP comprehensible (automatically)?
		1) Show the translation first? then video
			- chinese, english, chinese, english, actual-video
			- Show a background clip image instead of grey image
		2) Trim long spoken lines down to key phrases!
		- Start with word_report top words (and the phrases that use them)

	Word report on common_lib sources would be helpful.
		- key phrase report?

	Try doing a peppa pig CI show: pre-cede every line with the translation
		- now try it for adult-level content
		- when you've got this working, make it part of a SRS-optim feed.

	This stuff is mostly accessible (save a handful of words) but it just takes some time to deconstruct and parse the sentence. I think if it was just slowed-and-stepped, it would be ok.
	-> TRY THIS.
	
	I should be able to link a bilibili video, and put a few notes with timestamps there.
		- shouldn't need the whole video contents, just the 关键 notes from first 1-2 mins
		- E.g. 东南亚的华人移民 from BV1Jb4y1s7kr 青田人占50%左右
		- 德国也喜欢中国人勤劳善良的品格

	Scrape these videos, make them Comprehensible. 

	Log page requests and file exports as 'passive review'

	Scraping / making-CI-of-video-material:
		Youtube - he's here too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffsDnpy5RwY
		Bilibili - page source HAS opengraph tags ( https://ogp.me/ ) 
		https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JT4y1a7zw
			- This video id is on the phone info page

16 mins is too long to study from, but up to first 1:46 is nice.

I think if we take each line (or maybe just the difficult ones) and:
1) Give the Chinese
2) Give the english + per word translation
3) Give the Chinese again
Then, this makes the content CI without it getting dull.

弹幕敲个1
词幕
RUN谐音，就是指移民到中外

我们今天就较为系统的探讨一下
宏观的聊一聊世界移民的现状
macro-talk: world-migration current-situation.

联合国移民署
但数据来源截止到2020年
所以说才有参考价值

世界移民趋势的一个预测
这比1990年的1.53亿人多出了近一倍
世界人口流动在越来越频繁
欧洲目前是移民的最大目的地
欧洲北美等地仍然是移民聚集的地区
传统的移民大国如美国加拿大等
热度还是不减的
下降了2.4%

Feel like this is the BEST way to learn phrases that you can really use:
  - context and meaning is completely clearn, this provides the context and motivation


	Start scraping stuff with first 100 hanzi (by #rank) not reviewed in last month.
		- 1-3 sites is enough for use, don't need everything on commoncrawl
