HeatMap of Hanzi (and words) - quickly shows us what we have/have-not recently reviewed.
One click 'add' card (just like ANKI plugin on phone), instead of creating a Note first.
Images for flashcard common words - like 筛选 (I think ppl will want this)
Add alternative review types to /stats, add stats as a report link


HANZI FEATURES:
Hanzi should still be presented:
	- in context of high-freq word
	- inside a meaningful PHRASE (didn't do this on my anki deck)
		- One writing based from sohu
		- One speaking based from youglish / zerotohero
	- exploded decomposition should accompany new hanzi, so we learn to see the decomp:
		- emphasise differences from similar hanzi **
	- whole phrase spoken clearly and slowly (youglish is typically spoken too quickly to be clear)
	- picture or short video to give a sense of the idea

	
query_string vs POST body best practise:

NB - POST body is more for data than query params

Report features: Series_level_stats, include_known_words, sort_by_occurences, sort_by_video_time

NOTES ON VIDEO:

	Preceed / splice 5 new words/phrases based on:
		- High-use in the episode: 停电
		- High-use in the series: 恐龙, 乔治，花园
		- High-use in general language: 爸爸，妈妈，非常好

	I try listening to some video on 百度, 哔哩哔哩, zhihu, and although I know all the hanzi:
		- I can't quite understand the kouyin (speed? clarity?)
		- I feel vague about the meaning 

	Keep working on this video thing, it's got legs. Especially as a video board.
		- Compare word usage across all videos
		- Put the English bits inside the complete video (7.5Mb / 5 minute show).
		- Fix Paige -> Peppa!
		- Create an interface that you could leave them alone with, and they would explore 50 episodes of Peppa pig.

	How to make this PP comprehensible (automatically)?
		1) Show the translation first? then video
			- chinese, english, chinese, english, actual-video
			- Show a background clip image instead of grey image
		2) Trim long spoken lines down to key phrases!
		- Start with word_report top words (and the phrases that use them)

	Word report on common_lib sources would be helpful.
		- key phrase report?


Feel like this is the BEST way to learn phrases that you can really use:
  - context and meaning is completely clearn, this provides the context and motivation
