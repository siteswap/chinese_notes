Hanzi report: top 3000 | inc_refs | reviewed_月 | common_lib_例子
Be able to list phrases by most infrequently reviewed hanzi.
Rotating, novelty news feed? (Word report so static)

HANZI FEATURES:
Hanzi should still be presented:
	- in context of high-freq word
	- inside a meaningful PHRASE (didn't do this on my anki deck)
		- One writing based from sohu
		- One speaking based from youglish / zerotohero
	- exploded decomposition should accompany new hanzi, so we learn to see the decomp:
		- emphasise differences from similar hanzi
	- whole phrase spoken clearly and slowly (youglish is typically spoken too quickly to be clear)
	- picture or short video to give a sense of the idea

When you present a new character for first few times -> show the related hanzi that you already know, so that you can help build that WEB of connections.

Hanzi progress:
	Recognise hanzi use in full sentence
	Recognise hanzi in a word (same word used in that sentence)
	Recognise hanzi on it's own
	Write the hanzi when given a closure of a sentence
	
Export option:
	Hanzi phone/desktop wallpaper
